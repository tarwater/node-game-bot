I'm trying to find better trivia questions, but you can easily add your own. The current ones are taken from here: https://web.archive.org/web/20150418134735/http://www.irc-wiki.org/Category:Trivia_questions

**Note**: This bot requires the node-irc client library found here: https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc
